# Workshop 2: Migrate & Modernize with Agents

> _.NET & Java, Custom Agents, Copilot Chat_

---

## Overview

- **Duration:** 2.5 - 3 hours  
- **Format:** Instructor-led, guided hands-on workshop  
- **Difficulty:** 🟡 Intermediate to 🔴 Advanced  
- **Audience:** Developers, Tech Leads, Architects  
- **Focus:** Using custom AI agents to modernize existing .NET and Java applications

---

## 1. Workshop Purpose

This workshop demonstrates how **custom AI agents** can be used to **analyze, migrate, and modernize legacy applications**, with focus on .NET and Java ecosystems.

Participants will move beyond generic Copilot usage by **creating and applying a purpose-built agent** that understands modernization goals, constraints, and target architectures.

The emphasis is on **guided, repeatable modernization workflows**, not one-off refactoring.

---

## 2. Design Principles

- Modernization before migration
- Custom agents over generic prompting
- Incremental change, not big-bang rewrites
- Explicit constraints and target state
- Enterprise-safe patterns and decisions

---

## 3. Scope Decisions (Intentional)

### ✅ Included

- Copilot Chat for analysis and modernization
- Custom modernization agents (instruction-based)
- Structured modernization artifacts
- .NET Framework → .NET 8+ patterns
- Java 8 → Java 17+ patterns
- MCP as a **conceptual model** for shared context

### ❌ Excluded

- Full migration tooling (Azure Migrate, etc.)
- Database migration
- Infrastructure modernization
- Complete application rewrites

This keeps the workshop focused on **how agents improve modernization decisions**, not tooling complexity.

## 5. Agent Strategy for Modernization

Participants work with **three distinct agent roles**:

### 1. 🔍 Analysis Agent
- Understands the legacy codebase
- Identifies architectural smells
- Surfaces technical debt and outdated patterns

### 2. 🔄 Modernization Agent
- Applies modernization goals consistently
- Enforces target framework constraints
- Produces explainable, reviewable output

### 3. ✅ Review Agent
- Validates modernization against goals
- Identifies regressions or risks
- Ensures enterprise-safe patterns

> Agents are defined via **clear instructions**, not SDKs.

---

## 6. Agenda & Flow (2.5 - 3 Hours)

### 1. Introduction: Why Modernization Needs Agents ⏱️ _10 minutes_

**Why legacy modernization often fails:**
- Inconsistent refactoring decisions
- Loss of business logic during rewrites
- Scope creep and big-bang failures

**How agents help:**
- Consistent application of rules
- Explainable, reviewable changes
- Incremental, safe modernization

#### Flow Overview
```
Analyze → Define Goals → Create Agent → Modernize → Validate
```

**✅ Outcome:** Shared understanding of agent-driven modernization.

---

### 2. Lab 1: Understand the Legacy Application ⏱️ _25 minutes_

**Goal:** Build a shared understanding of the current state.

---

#### 📖 Step-by-Step Walkthrough

**Step 1: Explore the legacy codebase** (3 min)
```
Open the legacy-app/ folder and review:
- Project structure and organization
- Key entry points (Program.cs / Application.java)
- Configuration files
```

**Step 2: Identify architectural smells** (8 min)

Open Copilot Chat and add the legacy code files, then use this prompt:

```
Analyze this legacy [.NET/.Java] application and identify architectural smells:

1. God classes (classes doing too much)
2. Tight coupling between components
3. Missing abstraction layers
4. Hardcoded values and magic strings
5. Violation of SOLID principles

For each smell, provide:
- Location (file/class)
- Why it's a problem
- Modernization priority (High/Medium/Low)
```

✅ **Expected Output:** A prioritized list of architectural issues.

**Step 3: Identify deprecated patterns** (5 min)

Use this follow-up prompt:

```
Identify deprecated or outdated patterns in this codebase:

1. Deprecated .NET/Java APIs being used
2. Old authentication patterns
3. Legacy data access patterns (ADO.NET, raw JDBC)
4. Outdated dependency injection approaches
5. Obsolete configuration methods

For each, suggest the modern replacement.
```

**Step 4: Create technical debt heatmap** (5 min)

Use this prompt:

```
Create a technical debt heatmap for this codebase:

| Component/File | Debt Level | Key Issues | Effort to Fix |

Debt Levels: 🔴 High | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low

Focus on areas that will block modernization.
```

**Step 5: Document findings** (4 min)
- Copy analysis to `modernization/current-state.md`
- Highlight the top 5 issues to address
- Note dependencies between issues

---

#### 💡 Tips & Hints

| Challenge | Hint |
|-----------|------|
| 1.1 (architectural smells) | Look for classes >500 lines, methods >50 lines |
| 1.2 (deprecated APIs) | Search for `[Obsolete]` or `@Deprecated` annotations |
| 1.3 (debt heatmap) | Focus on code that's touched frequently |
| 1.4 (complexity score) | Consider: coupling, test coverage, documentation |

---

#### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

- ❌ **Boiling the ocean:** Don't try to fix everything - prioritize
- ❌ **Missing context:** Some "smells" might be intentional - ask why
- ❌ **Ignoring tests:** Legacy code without tests is higher risk

### 3. Lab 2: Define Modernization Goals & Constraints ⏱️ _20 minutes_

**Goal:** Make modernization intent explicit.

---

#### 📖 Step-by-Step Walkthrough

**Step 1: Define target state** (5 min)

Open Copilot Chat with your current-state analysis:

```
Based on @current-state.md, help me define a target modernization state:

1. Target framework version (.NET 8 / Java 17+)
2. Target architecture style (clean architecture, CQRS, etc.)
3. Target patterns (dependency injection, async/await, etc.)
4. Target infrastructure (containerized, cloud-native, etc.)

Be specific and measurable.
```

✅ **Expected Output:** A clear vision of the modernized application.

**Step 2: Define success criteria** (5 min)

Use this prompt:

```
Define measurable success criteria for this modernization:

1. Performance targets (response time, throughput)
2. Code quality metrics (coverage, complexity)
3. Security requirements (OWASP compliance)
4. Operational requirements (deployment frequency, rollback time)

Each criterion should be testable.
```

**Step 3: Identify constraints** (5 min)

Use this prompt:

```
Identify constraints for this modernization project:

1. Timeline constraints (deadlines, milestones)
2. Budget constraints (team size, tools)
3. Technical constraints (must-keep dependencies, integrations)
4. Business constraints (zero downtime, backward compatibility)

For each, note the consequence if violated.
```

**Step 4: Create phased roadmap** (5 min)

Use this prompt:

```
Create a phased modernization roadmap:

Phase 1: Foundation (weeks 1-2)
Phase 2: Core Migration (weeks 3-6)
Phase 3: Enhancement (weeks 7-8)

For each phase:
- What components to modernize
- Success criteria to verify
